# My personal website!
This is a project that I've put off for a VERY long time

This website is build statically and on SvelteKit, and it took about 10 hours to create V1 (V2 coming eventually). You can access the site at lynn89-sudo.github.io on mobile and desktop devices!

Main features
- Includes mostly original art - everything that is currently in the site or will be on the site is 100% designed by me, besides the Svelte logo that is.
- Navbar that appears once the user scrolls down aides site navigation; footer can also be used to navigate the site and includes a clock (Eastern Coast Timezone)
- Blog uses an RSS file and a separate GitHub repo (/blog) to serve blog content
- Site works well on all screen formats and has smooth transitions
